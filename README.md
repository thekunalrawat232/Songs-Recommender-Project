🎶 Song Recommender System
Welcome to my first machine learning project! I'm excited to share this song recommender system that I built using various machine learning libraries and tools. This project showcases my learning journey and how I've applied these tools to create something functional and fun.

🚀 Project Overview
This project is a Song Recommender System that suggests songs based on user preferences. I utilized several key libraries and frameworks to bring this project to life:

TensorFlow and scikit-learn for building and training the recommendation models.
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib for visualizing data insights and model performance.
Streamlit for creating a user-friendly web interface, allowing users to interact with the recommender system directly from their browsers.
🎯 Key Features
User Input: Users can input their favorite songs or artists, and the system will recommend similar songs.
Model Training: The recommendation model is trained on a dataset of songs and user preferences.
Real-Time Interaction: Thanks to Streamlit, users can see recommendations in real-time based on their inputs.
