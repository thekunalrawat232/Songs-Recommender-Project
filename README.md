<h1>🎶 Song Recommender System</h1>

<p>Welcome to my first machine learning project! I'm excited to share this song recommender system that I built using various machine learning libraries and tools. This project showcases my learning journey and how I've applied these tools to create something functional and fun.</p>

<h2>🚀 Project Overview</h2>

<p>This project is a <strong>Song Recommender System</strong> that suggests songs based on user preferences. I utilized several key libraries and frameworks to bring this project to life:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>TensorFlow</strong> and <strong>scikit-learn</strong> for building and training the recommendation models.</li>
    <li><strong>Pandas</strong> and <strong>NumPy</strong> for data manipulation and preprocessing.</li>
    <li><strong>Matplotlib</strong> for visualizing data insights and model performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Streamlit</strong> for creating a user-friendly web interface, allowing users to interact with the recommender system directly from their browsers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🎯 Key Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>User Input:</strong> Users can input their favorite songs or artists, and the system will recommend similar songs.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> The recommendation model is trained on a dataset of songs and user preferences.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Interaction:</strong> Thanks to Streamlit, users can see recommendations in real-time based on their inputs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🛠️ Tools & Libraries</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>TensorFlow</strong></li>
    <li><strong>scikit-learn</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Pandas</strong></li>
    <li><strong>NumPy</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Matplotlib</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Streamlit</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>💡 Future Improvements</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Enhancing the recommendation algorithm for better accuracy.</li>
    <li>Adding more features, such as personalized playlists.</li>
    <li>Improving the user interface for a better experience.</li>
</ul>
